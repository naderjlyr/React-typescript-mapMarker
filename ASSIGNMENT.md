# Programming assignment - Jobfeed Frontend developer

Your task is to make a simple application using React and Javascript, with necessary styling in SCSS or plain CSS.

## Data

The application displays the job data as available [here](https://us.jobfeed.com/data/info-recent-jobs). You can call the Jobfeed endpoint directly. No authentication is required.

## Functionality

-   The user should be presented with a nice overview of jobs
-   The user should be able to filter jobs "on the fly" by job title or organisation name
-   The user should be able to remove one or more jobs from the list
-   Unit tests - at least 1 or 2 tests, to demonstrate your approach to testing

### Optional features (only if you have time left)

-   Clicking on a job should point its location on a map. You can use any map service (Google Maps, Leaflet etc.).
-   Result pagination
-   Result sorting
-   End2End tests

## Styling

You don't have to do all of the styling from scratch, nor does the app have to be "mobile first", or support mobile in general.

If you wish you can use any open-source UI library for generic UI elements, including our [library](https://github.com/textkernel/oneui), or write your own if you prefer.

## Requirements

It should take you **Â±4 hours** to complete the assignment. We do not expect a production-ready app, but it should be a good working prototype the show-cases your skills. All code and supporting documents can be submitted by pushing to this repository.

### Result of the assignment

Your submission should contain the following:

-   Source code of your application
-   Instructions on how to run your application
-   Description of the approach and limitations of the implementation
-   Description of decisions that you made regarding the implementation

### Points of attention

-   Code quality, use of modern standards
-   Logical use / separation of components
-   Use of state and props
-   The UI should look appealing
